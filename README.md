# CMSI-186
Lucille Njoo, CMSI 186 Programming Lab, Loyola Marymount University
* Assignment 1: HelpfulMethods.java
  * A Java program that contains methods for computing the GCD of two numbers, the LCM of 2 numbers, and the sum of the digits of a number.
* Assignment 2: Clock.java and ClockSolver.java (Discrete Simulation)
  * A discrete simulation of an analog clock that determines all times between midnight and noon, inclusive, at which the hands of a clock form either a right angle or straight angle.
* Assignment 3: Tuple.java
  * A class representing a k-tuple, or an ordered list of >= 0 integers.
* Assignment 4: ChangeMaker.java (Dynamic Programming)
  * A Java program that solve the general problem of making change that inputs any arbitrary coin denominations and an amount of money, and outputs the optimal way of making change for the given amount.
* Assignment 5: PiSolver.java (Randomized Estimation - Monte Carlo)
  * A Java program that computes pi via randomized estimation.
* Assignment 6: BigInteger.java
  * Created the class BigInteger, whose objects model arbitrarily large integers. The methods of this class perform basic arithmetic on the BigIntegers using algorithms that manipulate arrays of digits.
* Assignment 7: Riemann.java and Random.java 
  * Riemann is a Java program that computes definite integrals using Riemann integration for polynomials of arbitrary degree.
  * Random is a Java program that computes definite integrals using randomized estimation (Monte Carlo).
